abstract - used to define abstract classes and methods that cannot be instantiated directly.
case - used for case classes and pattern matching.
catch - used in exception handling to capture and process exceptions.
class - defines a class.
def - used to define a function or method.
do - used in combination with while for do-while loops.
else - part of if expressions for alternative conditions.
enum - new in Scala 3, used to define enumerations.
export - allows exporting members from other objects or modules.
extends - used for inheritance in classes.
  false - represents the boolean value "false."
final - prevents overriding of classes or methods.
finally - used in exception handling to define a block that always executes.
for - used to define loops and comprehensions.
given - defines implicit values and instances in Scala 3, replacing many uses of implicit in Scala 2.
if - used for conditional branching.
implicit - used in Scala 2 for implicit parameters but replaced in Scala 3 by given and using.
import - imports members from other modules or packages.
lazy - delays initialization of a variable until it is accessed.
  match - used for pattern matching expressions.
  new - used to create instances of classes.
null - represents an absence of value (though generally avoided in Scala).
object - defines singleton objects.
  opaque - new in Scala 3, defines opaque types to hide implementation details.
override - used to override members from a superclass.
package - defines a package or namespace.
private - restricts access to a class or package.
protected - allows access only within a class and its subclasses.
return - returns a value from a function (often omitted in Scala).
sealed - restricts inheritance to the current file.
super - references the superclass.
  this - refers to the current instance of an object.
throw - used to throw an exception.
trait - defines abstract behavior that can be mixed into classes.
true - represents the boolean value "true."
try - wraps code that might throw exceptions.
type - defines an alias or custom type.
using - used in Scala 3 for dependency injection with implicit parameters.
val - defines an immutable value (cannot be changed after assignment).
var - defines a mutable variable (can be changed).
while - used for while loops.
with - used for mixin inheritance.
yield - returns values in for comprehensions, creating a new collection.

Scala 3 also introduces keywords like given, using, and opaque to enhance type safety and modularity.
